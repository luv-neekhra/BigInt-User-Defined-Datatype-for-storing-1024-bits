# BigInt-User-Defined-Datatype-for-storing-1024-bits
*  Implemented ‘BigInt’ data type with operations (+, -, *) for
supporting 1024 bit ints
*  In C/C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a
   max of 20. And we want to store the 22 digit number which is
   not easy to store in any kind of primitive type. So to deal with
  this type of problem we design a new data type called BigInt.
